  I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire <br/>
  I know I created myself <br/>
  I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights <br/>
  But I never asked for your help <br/>
  <br/><br/>
  You got nerves<br/>
  But they never show unless they hurt <br/>
  So you blamed it all on my love <br/>
  The moving heart I got <br/>
  <br/><br/>
  But I don't need a cure for me <br/>
  I don't need it <br/>
  No, I don't need a cure for me <br/>
  I don't need it <br/>
  No, I don't need a cure for me <br/>
  I don't need it <br/>
  I don't need it <br/>
